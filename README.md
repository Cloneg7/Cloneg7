## Python I/O Example

Here's a simple Python script that demonstrates basic file I/O operations. This script reads content from a file and writes it to another file:

```python
# Python I/O Example

# Function to read from a file
def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content

# Function to write to a file
def write_file(file_path, content):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)

# Main function
def main():
    input_file = 'input.txt'
    output_file = 'output.txt'
    
    # Read from input file
    content = read_file(input_file)
    print(f"Read from {input_file}:")
    print(content)
    
    # Write to output file
    write_file(output_file, content)
    print(f"Content written to {output_file}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
