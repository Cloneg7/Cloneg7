## Cool Python Project

Here's a little Python script I wrote recently. It generates a random inspirational quote each time you run it. Check it out below!

```python
import random

quotes = [
    "The best way to predict the future is to invent it. - Alan Kay",
    "Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it. - Charles R. Swindoll",
    "The only way to do great work is to love what you do. - Steve Jobs",
    "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today. - Franklin D. Roosevelt",
    "Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking. - William Butler Yeats"
]

def get_random_quote():
    return random.choice(quotes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Here's your inspirational quote for the day:")
    print(get_random_quote())
